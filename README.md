# 🛒 Market List - Built with Bubble

A simple and efficient market list app built using the Bubble no-code platform.

## 🚀 Project Description

This app allows users to quickly add, edit, and manage a shopping list. It was built as a personal practice project to learn Bubble workflows and database handling.

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal was to train simple workflows and logic in Bubble. It helped solidify my understanding of Bubble's front-end elements and data structure. Although I made several beginner mistakes during development, I iterated and improved the project as I progressed.

## ✅ Features
